Select a specific header or random header image for each content item or archive page.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you specify a header image for each post, page, custom post type or archive page individually, from your default headers and custom headers.

It adds a meta box in the post edit screens with the header selection and a settings field in the edit profile and each taxonomy edit screen.
If no specific header is specified for a post it will fall back to the default selection.
There is no change of template files necessary as this plugin hooks in the existing WordPress API to unfold its magic.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I need in the `header.php` file to make the plugin work seamlessly? =
To make it work in your `header.php` file all you need is a `header_image()` call like so:

`<img src="<?php header_image(); ?>" width="<?php echo get_custom_header()->width; ?>" height="<?php echo get_custom_header()->height; ?>" alt="" />`

See TwentyTwelve's `header.php` for reference.
